# TypeScript Order Platform -- Monolith (TS_V12_ESBUILD_PNPM_MONO)

Tool-evaluation repository for **Node 12**, bundled with **esbuild**,
managed with **pnpm**, in a **Monolith** layout.

This is branch **TS_V12_ESBUILD_PNPM_MONO** of the consolidated `typescript-corpus` repository, which holds all 216 TypeScript branches across every Node version, bundler, package manager and architecture combination in this corpus.

## Project type

- **Language:** TypeScript 5.0.4
- **Runtime:** Node 12 (verified against 12.22.12)
- **Scenario:** 1 - Monolithic
- **Architecture:** Monolith
- **Module layout:** flat
- **Bundler:** esbuild 0.21.5 (esbuild transform and linker)
- **Package manager:** pnpm 6.35.1
- **Source root:** `src`

Node 12 is end-of-life, and that is deliberate: it pins the entire toolchain to
the last release of each tool that still supports it. Every version in this
repository was resolved against the live npm registry and then executed on a
real Node 12.22.12 interpreter. None was written from memory.

## Build

```bash
npm i -g pnpm@6.35.1
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run build
pnpm run bundle
```

`pnpm run build` type-checks with `tsc --noEmit` and emits CommonJS + declarations to
`dist/`; `pnpm run bundle` then bundles with **esbuild 0.21.5 (esbuild transform and linker)** and **executes the bundle**.
Emitting is not proof; running it is.

## Run

```bash
node dist/src/index.js
```

## Test

```bash
pnpm run test        # mocha over tests/
pnpm run coverage    # c8 (primary) AND nyc + ts-node (cross-check)
```

Both coverage tools must report non-zero. They deliberately disagree: c8 reads
V8 coverage of the emitted output and remaps it, while nyc instruments the
TypeScript AST directly through `ts-node/register`. Identical numbers would mean
one of them is not an independent second opinion.

`nyc` here never reports through a source-map remap. Doing so silently yields
0% -- the file is remapped to `.ts`, an `--include` written against `dist/**`
stops matching, and the report empties while the process still exits 0.

## Architecture

**Monolith.** One deployable package. `package.json` declares **no**
`workspaces` field, the module tree under `src/` is flat, and there is no
`services/` directory. Those are exactly the properties an auditor reads to
classify a repository, so they are the ones held true here.

```
src/
  index.ts            public surface + sample runner
  models/             domain records and tax table (leaf layer)
  services/           pricing rules, order service, the duplicate pair
  platform/           integrations that use the planted dependency pins
  analysis/           planted fixtures -- never imported by real code
```

`dependency-cruiser` enforces the layering: `models/` may not import
`services/`, and nothing outside `analysis/` may import `analysis/`.


## Tool test-data folders

This repo carries only `Tool Triggering (Tool Github Test data)/` from testable-platform/typescript-corpus's original per-branch task-data folders.

### `Tool Triggering (Tool Github Test data)/`
Each of the 39 tool subfolders is that tool's own real upstream code and test
suite, pulled as-is from its actual GitHub project -- not generated. `covgate/`
is the clearest case: it's genuinely Rust, not TypeScript -- `cli_interface.rs`,
`coverage_parse.rs`, `gate.rs`, `git_module.rs`, `metrics.rs`,
`render_console.rs`, `render_markdown.rs` plus its own `fixtures/`, `helpers/`
and `support/` test directories, straight from the covgate project. `ESLint/`,
`StrykerJS/`, `Opengrep/`, `pydriller/` and the rest are each that project's
own real test suite. A correct run finds whatever that upstream project's own
tests genuinely contain. `TraceGraph/` is the exception: it holds only a note, because that project publishes no public repository.
