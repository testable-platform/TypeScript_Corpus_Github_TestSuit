# TypeScript Corpus -- Tool Triggering (Tool Github Test data)

`main` carries only this overview -- it holds no project code. Every other
branch in this repository is one cell of `testable-platform/typescript-corpus`, split out to carry
only the `Tool Triggering (Tool Github Test data)/` folder (plus that branch's own build scaffolding).

This repository was produced by splitting `testable-platform/typescript-corpus` by task folder.
`testable-platform/typescript-corpus` itself was not modified by this split and still holds the
full combined corpus.

## Scope

This repo covers 24 branches, all carrying byte-identical content -- this folder does not vary by .NET family, bundler, package manager or architecture. Branch names are borrowed from the node12 family's combo set purely for naming consistency with the sibling repos.

## Branch naming

Branch names are unchanged from `testable-platform/typescript-corpus`:

```
TS_V{family}_{BUNDLER}_{PACKAGE_MANAGER}_{ARCHITECTURE}
```

## Finding a branch

Each branch's own `README.md` describes its exact cell (Node family, bundler,
package manager, architecture) and its tool roster, trimmed to the parts
relevant to `Tool Triggering (Tool Github Test data)/`. `dataset.json` on each branch is the
machine-readable answer key for that cell (unmodified by this split -- it
still describes the branch's original full tool/5-folder state).

## History

Each branch's commit history is carried over unchanged from `testable-platform/typescript-corpus`,
with one additional commit on top that removes the folders not relevant to
this repo. Nothing was squashed or rewritten.
